# 🔍 Cross ChaMotor Search Engine

**Cross ChaMotor** is a modular semantic search engine designed to operate across symbolic systems, blockchain networks, and signal environments.  
It is part of the Raven Stars ecosystem, enabling intelligent queries that combine meaning, motion, and modular logic.

This engine doesn't just search — it navigates.

## 🌌 Philosophy

In Raven Stars, every unit is symbolic.  
Cross ChaMotor interprets these units — linguistic, mathematical, blockchain-based, or signal-driven — and finds harmony across them.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Cross-Chain Awareness**  
  Search across Raven Stars blockchain, Stellar network, and external ledgers.

- 🧠 **Semantic Matching**  
  Match symbolic units based on label, category, and value — not just keywords.

- 🌠 **Star Path Navigation**  
  Use the Star Drawing algorithm to traverse conceptual paths and discover meaningful connections.

- 📡 **Signal Interpretation**  
  Integrate radar and signal data into the search logic.

- 🧩 **Modular Queries**  
  Build queries from code units (e.g., `ROLE-S`, `VAR-X`, `RHYM-A`) and analyze harmony.

- 🧾 **Blockchain Logging**  
  Record search results as transactions in the Raven Stars blockchain for permanent traceability.
